    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>The Wugong mountains are a range of mountains located between Jiangxi and Hunan provinces in China. The summit is the 1918.3 m “Golden Peak”. </p><p>Famous for the endless meadows, clear sky and the milky way, Wugong mountains proves to be a good sport for those who love hiking and camping.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://cl.ly/c0176d1cf13f" alt="meteor"></p><p>August has always been one of the best months for stargazing: the weather is not too cold and the galaxy is noor to dim, not to mention the <strong>Perseids</strong> which peaks at August 12th or 13th.</p><p>I planned to watch the meteor shower early in 2018, as last year came out to be a total disaster – camping in Pok-tai island in Hong Kong, we saw nothing other than hundreds of airplanes flying over our heads with flashing lights.</p><p>So, I made an survey, and with the help of the <a href="https://lightpollutionmap.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>light pollution map</em></a> , I found out that there were not so many cities with a convinient transport and a clear sky. I decided to have another excursion in Wugong mountains again, where I saw the milky way in June last year.</p><p>The normal slower train takes a night from <strong>Guangzhou (Kanton)</strong>, Guangdong to <strong>Pingxiang</strong>, Jiangxi Province, and the bullet train (high speed train) takes 3.5 hours. </p><h2 id="August-11th-2018"><a href="#August-11th-2018" class="headerlink" title="August 11th, 2018"></a>August 11th, 2018</h2><p>After we got to the Pingxiang Railway station, we had a rest and a breakfast, and a taxi took us to the starting point of the hiking trail at 11:00.</p><p><img src="https://cl.ly/f5f09e7cbf36" alt="woods"></p><p>Hiking always appears quite boring at the foot of the mountains, but we were not frustrated by the long-time-no-see green woods. We walked really slowly under the shades and the sun.</p><p><img src="https://cl.ly/f5f09e7cbf36" alt="meadow"></p><p>It took us 5 hours to get to the meadows, and it would take 2 more hours to the Golden Peak. However, as the sun went down, the clouds and the winds began gathering, and it may not be wise to camp on the peak or the ridge – the wind would be constantly flapping the tents, bringing the sleepless night. So as we passed the “Yuquanlou Inn”, I asked the owner if we could camp in the hall, and he nodded yes.</p><p>At 21:00, my friend Helen went outside, and to her surprise, the milky way was so clearly, so we carried our cameras and tripods out immediately.<br>Standing on the ridges, in the gales, we were shaking and could barely hold the tripods steadily. We set our cameras to the long exposure mode, held our breath and took a first picture – everything was just stunning – the Mars and the Saturn was sparkling so brightly, and the galaxy was incredibly clear.</p><p>We tried to wait for the meteor, only to find that it was too chilly and windy, and we went back when the fog began permeating in the valley.</p><h2 id="August-12th-2018"><a href="#August-12th-2018" class="headerlink" title="August 12th, 2018"></a>August 12th, 2018</h2><p>Some tourists in our neighbouring tent talked into late night, and none of us had a sound sleep. When sunrise came, we didn’t hesitate to get up.It was below 10 degree celsius, and the wind was just to mild to blow away the thick fog. </p><p><img src="https://cl.ly/dd0453db5d1e" alt="sunrise"></p><p><em>However, an oddly-shaped lenticular cloud caught my attention.</em></p><p>We finished our breakfast and took off. High up in the mountains, there were tiny fragrant flowers decorating the grassland, and seeding silvergrasses turning red. Everything gave some new vibrant colours. </p><p><img src="https://cl.ly/270d7c2b4f29" alt="mountains"></p><p>But the weather changed so rapidly, and it began to drizzling. So we put on our raincoats, and appreciated the strange flowers including some clusters of sage surrounded by hard-working bees.</p><p><img src="https://cl.ly/fea0769bcf85" alt="plants"></p><p>We arrived at the next Diaomazhuang inn at 14:00, and there were just a few guests who planned to spend the night as the next day is Monday. Actually, this inn has always been my best choice to observe the stars as it sets in a dark surrounding.</p><p>After a shower, a nap and a dinner, unfortunately, the bad weather gave us little confidence – the thunders were forcasting a heavy rain. We went back to the room depressed and tired. Still, Helen tried to cheer me up, and said that we can check again in the midnight. </p><p>“Wow! A METEOR! I saw it! “ There was a scream from downstairs. Though still puzzled, I went to the hallway and pushed the window open, and saw millions of twinkling stars hanging in the dome with my own eyes – I rubbed them, and realised that I couldn’t miss this chance. So we fetched my camera and my tripods and hurried downstairs.</p><p>It’s not possible at all for us to surpress the excitement. We wouldn’t want to blink our eyes, as if the stars would disappear within no time. Two other girls came together, and we discussed the location of the Perseus, and set our cameras in different directions. Some meteors went by above us just within the few minutes, all of us were screaming in excitement.</p><p><img src="https://cl.ly/548a0cab6e97" alt="meteor_center"></p><p>The meteors showed up rather sporadically – sometimes they blinked an eye just above the horizon, and sometimes they travelled in the middle of the sky with a long tail. It was too hard to capture their traces.<br>Just when we were laughing, a meteor, almost as bright as Mars, appeared in the dead zone of our cameras without a sign. It blazed across the sky with a long, yellow trail, for as long as a second.<br>Still, we did not have enough time to make a wish. And even if I could, I might just wish for a few more hours of clear night.</p><p>After two hours, Helen decided to went back to sleep. But I had a strong feeling: If I left, I would have no more chances. </p><p>So I changed my spot, set my camera on automation mode, sat on the stairs, listened to the fountain babbling and watched the stars twinkling. Everything was asleep: the bugs were no longer chirping, and a slight snoring came out of a tent nearby. The whole universe seemed to be mine, and I was also a part of it. A feeling of solitude and happiness struck me simultaneously.</p><p>Yet it was too cold even in a downcoat for three hours. I went back to the inn, took one more picture, and gently opened the gate and went upstairs.</p><p><img src="https://cl.ly/7fa5bfae8f59" alt="meteor_inn"></p><h2 id="August-13th-2018"><a href="#August-13th-2018" class="headerlink" title="August 13th, 2018"></a>August 13th, 2018</h2><p>The peak time of the meteor shower finally came at 4:00. Sadly, the valley was covered with thick fog, as if we were looking through a frosted glass.<br>We went to the Ziji Palace to take the cable car. On the way down the mountain, we found this little strange creature, and the first name came to me was “stick insect” as it really resembled the shape of a stick or bamboo, and I was very lucky to be right.<br>Pretty soon enough, we went back to the tourist center and took a bus to the city center, thus ended our trip of stargazing.</p><p><img src="https://cl.ly/aa79b2024d03" alt="stick_insect"></p><h2 id="Postscript"><a href="#Postscript" class="headerlink" title="Postscript:"></a>Postscript:</h2><p>With more inns, more pricy food, more dazzling lights, and a fuller cellphone signal coverage, Wugong Mountains are welcoming more tourists than ever. But is it the best way to run a tourist attraction? </p><p>Unlike Hongkong, which holds so many national parks and keeps them all so naturally, Wukong Mountains are a little too hasty when trying to make the best use of the resources and beauty. These recreations and reconstructions, to my opinion, brings damages to some extent: the pure natural landscape is packed with man-made stairways and viewing platforms, making it looks like a huge amusement park with hundreds of tents and strong lights for a night gala. I kind of miss it as a a natural park for hiking and enjoying the green sceneries.</p>]]></content>
