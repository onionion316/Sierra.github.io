<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/02/07/5c5bb1b592ee4.jpg" alt="meteor"><br><em>a light meteor with a short trail</em></p>
<p>August is one of the best months for stargazing: the weather is not too cold and the galaxy is nor to dim, not to mention the <em>Perseids</em> that peaks on August 12th or 13th.</p>
<p>In 2017, I went to Pok-tai island in <strong>Hong Kong</strong> to watch the perseids – the hundreds of airplanes flying over our heads with flashing lights and the severe light pollution made the whole trip a total disaster. </p>
<p>So, in 2018, I planned to choose a dark place. With the help of the <a href="https://lightpollutionmap.info" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>light pollution map</em></a> , I found out that a convenient, dark place is rare in Southern China, so I decided to go to Wugong mountain again, where I saw the milky way in June in 2017.</p>
<p>The normal slower train takes a night from <strong>Guangzhou (Kanton)</strong>, Guangdong Province to <strong>Pingxiang</strong>, Jiangxi Province, and the bullet train (high speed train) takes 3.5 hours. </p>
<h2 id="August-11th-2018"><a href="#August-11th-2018" class="headerlink" title="August 11th, 2018"></a>August 11th, 2018</h2><p>After we got to the Pingxiang Railway station, we had a rest and a breakfast. Later, a taxi took us to the beginning of the hiking trail.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/02/07/5c5bb3370b14e.jpg" alt="woods"><br><em>pine trees</em></p>
<p>All seems quite boring at the foot of the mountains, but we were rather excited to see the long-time-no-see green woods, and walked really slowly under the shades and the sun.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/02/07/5c5bb32ee9063.jpg" alt="meadow"><br><em>hills and grassland</em></p>
<p>It took 5 hours to get to the meadows, and 2 more to the Golden Peak. However, as the sun went down, the clouds and the winds began gathering, and it wasn’t wise to camp on the peak or the ridge – the wind would constantly flap the tents, bringing a sleepless night. So as we reached the “Yuquanlou Inn”, I asked the owner if we could camp in the hall, and he nodded yes.</p>
<p>At 21:00, Helen and I carried our cameras and tripods out.<br>In the gales, we shook so much that we could barely hold the tripods steadily, but we managed to set our cameras to the long exposure mode, held our breath and took a first picture – everything was stunning – the Mars and the Saturn was sparkling so brightly, and the galaxy was incredibly clear.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/02/07/5c5bb983c381c.jpg" alt="first_night_meteor"><br><em>a meteor on the upper right corner, the yellor bright star is Mars</em></p>
<p>We tried to wait for the meteor, only to find that it was too chilly and windy. So we went back before our hands felt frozen. </p>
<h2 id="August-12th-2018"><a href="#August-12th-2018" class="headerlink" title="August 12th, 2018"></a>August 12th, 2018</h2><p>Some tourists in our neighbouring tent talked into late night, and none of us had a sound sleep. When sunrise came, we didn’t hesitate to get up. Unfornately, the wind was just to mild to blow away the thick fog. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/02/07/5c5bb99ddfd44.jpg" alt="sunrise"><br><em>an oddly-shaped lenticular cloud on the right side</em></p>
<p>We finished our breakfast and took off. High up in the mountains, there were tiny fragrant flowers decorating the grassland, and seeding silvergrasses are turning red. Everything gave new vibrant colours to the meadows. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/02/07/5c5bb33a04971.jpg" alt="mountains"><br><em>fog and mountains, and a few hikers</em></p>
<p>The weather changed rapidly, and soon it began to drizzle. We put on our raincoats, and appreciated the cute flowers.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/02/07/5c5bbbb5ece0c.jpg" alt="plants"></p>
<p>We arrived at the Diaomazhuang Inn at 14:00, and there were just a few guests who planned to spend the night as the next day was Monday. Actually, this inn has always been my best choice to observe the stars as it sets in a dark surrounding.</p>
<p>After a shower, a nap and dinner, sadly, the bad weather gave us little confidence – the thunders were forcasting a heavy rain. We went back to the room depressed and tired. Still, Helen tried to cheer me up, and said that we can check again in the midnight. </p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/02/07/5c5bb98072d70.jpg" alt="thunder"><br><em>thunders and thick clouds</em></p>
<p>“Wow! A METEOR! I saw it! “ There was a scream from downstairs. Though still puzzled, I went to the hallway and pushed the window open, and saw millions of twinkling stars hanging in the dome with my own eyes.</p>
<p>We hurried downstairs. It’s not possible at all for us to surpress the excitement. Neither of us would to blink our eyes, as if the stars would disappear within no time. Two girls came along, and we discussed the location of the Perseus, and set our cameras in different directions. Some meteors went by above us just within the few minutes, all of us were screaming in excitement.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/02/07/5c5bb956bb324.jpg" alt="meteor_center"><br><em>a dim meteor passed the center of the galaxy</em></p>
<p>The meteors showed up rather sporadically – sometimes they blinked an eye near the horizon, and sometimes they travelled in the middle of the sky with a long tail. When we were laughing, a meteor, almost as bright as Mars, appeared in the dead zone of our cameras without a sign. It blazed across the sky with a long, yellow trail, for as long as a second.<br>Still, we were in such a big surprise, that we did not have enough time to make a wish. And even if I could, I might just wish for a few more hours of clear night.</p>
<p>After two hours, Helen decided to went back to sleep. But I had a strong feeling: If I left, I would have no more chances. </p>
<p>So I changed my spot, set my camera on automation mode, sat on the stairs, listened to the fountain babbling and watched the stars twinkling. Everything was asleep: the bugs were no longer chirping, and a slight snoring came out of a tent nearby. The whole universe seemed to be mine, and I was also a part of it. A feeling of solitude and happiness struck me simultaneously.</p>
<p>Yet it was too cold even in a downcoat for three hours. I went back to the inn, took one more picture, and gently opened the gate.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/02/07/5c5bb99432767.jpg" alt="inn"></p>
<h2 id="August-13th-2018"><a href="#August-13th-2018" class="headerlink" title="August 13th, 2018"></a>August 13th, 2018</h2><p>At 4:00, the theoratical peak time for meteor shower, the valley was covered with thick fog again, as if we were looking through a frosted glass.<br>We slept for 3 more hours, and went back directly by cable car. On the way to the cable car station in Ziji Palace, we found this little, cute, strange creature, and the first name came to me was “stick insect” since it really resembled the shape of a stick, and I was very lucky to be right.<br>Pretty soon enough, we went back to the tourist center and took a bus to the city center, thus ended our trip of stargazing.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.loli.net/2019/02/07/5c5bb99975e49.jpg" alt="stick_insect"><br><em>a stick insect with only 5 legs</em></p>
<h2 id="Postscript"><a href="#Postscript" class="headerlink" title="Postscript:"></a>Postscript:</h2><p>Unlike Hongkong, which holds so many national parks and keeps them all so naturally, Wukong Mountain is a little too hasty when trying to make the best use of the resources and beauty. </p>
<p>The recreations and reconstructions, including inns, dazzling lights, cement trails, making the mountain looks like a huge amusement park with hundreds of tents and lights for night galas. I miss the quiet old days.</p>
